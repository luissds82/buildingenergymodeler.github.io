### Installation
The PyBEM module requires the following anciliary software, packages, and libraries:
  - [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/) or [above](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/) - a modern programming language
  - [EnergyPlus 8.9.0](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v8.9.0) - a whole building energy simulation software
  - [eppy](https://eppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) - a python-based programming language for EnergyPlus input and output files
  - [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)- a package for scientific computing with Python 
  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - a Python package for data analysis 
  - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html) - a Python 2D data visualization library

### Using PyBEM - A quick tutorial
<details> 
  <summary> <b> Creating a building (energy model) </b> </summary>
  
  First of all we need to import the PyBEM module, the PyBEM class, methods, attributes, and auxiliary functions.
  ```python
  import pybem
  from pybem import *
  ```
  Then we call the 'BEM' class to instantiate an building energy model (BEM). To instantiate the class we need to provide (in order): 
  1. Number of floors
  2. Width
  3. Length
  4. Floor Height - by default is set to 3 m
  5. Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) - by default is set to 40 (%)
  6. Location - i.e., the path to an EnergyPlus weather (epw) file, that contains Typical Metereological Year data of a specific location. By default is set to Phoenix, AZ
  7. Rotation - by default is set to 0&deg;
  
  Below is an example of how to create a BEM of a 60 by 30 m building with 5 floors with PyBEM. The floor height, location, WWR, and rotation are kept as default.
  ```python
  bldg = BEM(5, 60, 30)
  ```
